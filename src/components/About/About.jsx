      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Biosystems Engineer from the University of Sao Paulo who
        transitioned to frontend development through the Women Can Code program.
        I have a postgraduate specialization in Software Engineering and am
        skilled in Agile Methodologies, React, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, Hooks,
        Gatsby, REST APIs, i18n, and unit testing with Jest/testing-library.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have experience working at Venturus and am currently engaged in an
        international experience at Farfetch, developing and enhancing internal
        web applications using JavaScript, React, Bootstrap, and SCSS, with
        Firebase for backend services.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was the sole web developer responsible for building an internal
        application initially using JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, and CSS. When
        the application scaled, I rebuilt it using React, SCSS, and Firebase,
        helping to overcome a significant process previously managed using
        spreadsheets. I worked closely with the Data team, leading to the
        creation of a new position on the team for me to train a new web
        developer.
